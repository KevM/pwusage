## Remove Temporal polyfill after Node.js 26 LTS

`src/lib/billing-cycle.ts` now uses `@js-temporal/polyfill` for timezone-aware date arithmetic. Once Node.js 26 reaches LTS (~mid-2026), remove the polyfill dependency and use native `Temporal` from the runtime instead.

**Change:** Replace `import { Temporal } from '@js-temporal/polyfill'` with `import { Temporal } from 'temporal'` (or native global if available) and remove `@js-temporal/polyfill` from `package.json`.

## Update trmnl markup with Framework 3.1

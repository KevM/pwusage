## How to use this list

When starting fresh work in this repo, check this file. If a session begins something here, leave a short note (date + branch/PR) under the item so the next session knows it's in flight. Once landed, delete the item.

## Remove Temporal polyfill after Node.js 26 LTS

`src/lib/billing-cycle.ts` now uses `@js-temporal/polyfill` for timezone-aware date arithmetic. Once Node.js 26 reaches LTS (~mid-2026), remove the polyfill dependency and use native `Temporal` from the runtime instead.

**Change:** Replace `import { Temporal } from '@js-temporal/polyfill'` with `import { Temporal } from 'temporal'` (or native global if available) and remove `@js-temporal/polyfill` from `package.json`.

## Investigate Tesla JWKS signature verification failures

**Status:** Implemented lazy refresh strategy with fallback to nonce-only validation (2026-05-12, fix-security branch).

Currently, Tesla ID tokens are signed with keys that don't appear in the public JWKS endpoint, even after lazy refresh with cache-busting headers. This appears to be a Tesla infrastructure issue (globally distributed CDN with eventual consistency, aggressive key rotation).

**Current behavior:** Authentication works via nonce validation (CSRF-secure), but signature verification fails.

**Next steps (when prioritized):**
1. Check if this affects production or is staging-only
2. Contact Tesla to understand key rotation grace period
3. Consider implementing key caching (keep recently-used keys for N hours)
4. Monitor error rates in production to assess urgency

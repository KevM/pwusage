# TODO

Cross-session work that didn't fit the current focus. Pull from this list when picking up new work.

## How to use this list

When starting fresh work in this repo, check this file. If a session begins something here, leave a short note (date + branch/PR) under the item so the next session knows it's in flight. Once landed, delete the item.

## TRMNL: Loose Pending Installation Flow Note

- **Note (2026-07-01):** The loose-pending fallback flow (installation row with NULL `uuid` and NULL `plugin_setting_id`, claimed by the next webhook within 15 minutes) has been retained. Database inspection confirmed that loose installations still occur (most recent on June 23, 2026). This fallback remains necessary to handle cases where `plugin_setting_id` is missing from the callback URL during manual setups or when the TRMNL API `fetchMe` fails. Revisit and remove this flow if loose installs stop appearing after the manual-install path is fixed.


## Remove vestigial Go code (low priority)

The Go tree (`cmd/pwrtool`, `internal/`, `go.mod`/`go.sum`) and the legacy Svelte app (`cmd/web-app`) predate the Next.js app and are kept only as reference for how things used to work. Delete them when convenient — nothing depends on them.

## Remove Temporal polyfill after Node.js 26 LTS

`src/lib/billing-cycle.ts` now uses `@js-temporal/polyfill` for timezone-aware date arithmetic. Once Node.js 26 reaches LTS (~mid-2026), remove the polyfill dependency and use native `Temporal` from the runtime instead.

**Change:** Replace `import { Temporal } from '@js-temporal/polyfill'` with `import { Temporal } from 'temporal'` (or native global if available) and remove `@js-temporal/polyfill` from `package.json`.

## Node deprecation warning

```bash
(node:62351) [DEP0205] DeprecationWarning: `module.register()` is deprecated. Use `module.registerHooks()` instead.
(Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)
```
